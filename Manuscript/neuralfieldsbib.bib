   abstract = {We consider a class of particle systems described by differential equations (both stochastic and deterministic), in which the interaction network is determined by the realization of an Erdős–Rényi graph with parameter [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the size of the graph (i.e. the number of particles). If [Formula: see text], the graph is the complete graph (mean field model) and it is well known that, under suitable hypotheses, the empirical measure converges as [Formula: see text] to the solution of a PDE: a McKean–Vlasov (or Fokker–Planck) equation in the stochastic case, or a Vlasov equation in the deterministic one. It has already been shown that this holds for rather general interaction networks, that include Erdős–Rényi graphs with [Formula: see text], and properly rescaling the interaction to account for the dilution introduced by [Formula: see text]. However, these results have been proven under strong assumptions on the initial datum which has to be chaotic, i.e. a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables. The aim of our contribution is to present results — Law of Large Numbers and Large Deviation Principle — assuming only the convergence of the empirical measure of the initial condition.},

abstract = {In this manuscript we analyze the collective behavior of mean-field limits of large-scale, spatially extended stochastic neuronal networks with delays. Rigorously, the asymptotic regime of such systems is characterized by a very intricate stochastic delayed integro-differential McKean–Vlasov equation that remain impenetrable, leaving the stochastic collective dynamics of such networks poorly understood. In order to study these macroscopic dynamics, we analyze networks of firing-rate neurons, i.e. with linear intrinsic dynamics and sigmoidal interactions. In that case, we prove that the solution of the mean-field equation is Gaussian, hence characterized by its two first moments, and that these two quantities satisfy a set of coupled delayed integro-differential equations. These equations are similar to usual neural field equations, and incorporate noise levels as a parameter, allowing analysis of noise-induced transitions. We identify through bifurcation analysis several qualitative transitions due to noise in the mean-field limit. In particular, stabilization of spatially homogeneous solutions, synchronized oscillations, bumps, chaotic dynamics, wave or bump splitting are exhibited and arise from static or dynamic Turing–Hopf bifurcations. These surprising phenomena allow further exploring the role of noise in the nervous system.}

Examples include Erd\H\{o\}s-R\'enyi graphs with edge probability $p_n$, $n$ is the number of vertices, such that $\lim_\{n \to \infty\}p_n n= \infty$. The purpose of this note it twofold: (1) to establish this proximity on finite time horizon, by exploiting the fact that both systems are accurately described by a Fokker-Planck PDE (or, equivalently, by a nonlinear diffusion process) in the $n=\infty$ limit; (2) to remark that in reality this result is unsatisfactory when it comes to applying it to systems with $N$ large but finite, for example the values of $N$ that can be reached in simulations or that correspond to the typical number of interacting units in a biological system.},

This is the natural continuation of a previous work, where the homogeneous Erd\H os-R\'enyi case was considered. The class of graphs we consider includes disordered $W$-random graphs, with possibly unbounded graphons. The main result concerns a quenched convergence (that is true for almost every realization of the random graph) of the empirical measure of the system towards the solution of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck PDE with spatial extension, also appearing in different contexts, especially in neuroscience. The convergence of the spatial profile associated to the diffusions is also considered, and one proves that the limit is described in terms of a nonlinear integro-differential equation which matches the neural field equation in certain particular cases.},

Examples include the stochastic Kuramoto model with pairwise interactions given by an Erdős–Rényi graph. Our problem is to compare the bulk behavior of such systems with that of corresponding systems with dense nonrandom interactions. For a broad class of interaction functions, we find the optimal sparsity condition that implies that the two systems have the same hydrodynamic limit, which is given by a McKean–Vlasov diffusion. Moreover, we also prove matching behavior of the two systems at the level of large deviations. Our results extend classical results of dai Pra and den Hollander and provide the first examples of LDPs for systems with sparse random interactions.},
